  |                                                                         |
  |   * The game is composed of a series of stages and there are ghosts     |
  |     and locked doors within each stage. Greco and his ghosts will       |
  |     present the player with problems that they will need to solve in    |
  |     order to defeat the ghosts, unlock the doors, and proceed to the    |
  |     next stage                                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * The player can face off against and defeat ghosts. Doing so will    |
  |     earn the player treasures(items) and ghost coins which can be       |
  |     used to reveal hints and unlock special bonus stages                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Your child can happily play while studying math and develop         |
  |     stronger skills regarding division after some time                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Choosing the correct number will cause the ghost to take damage,    |
  |     reducing its HP(health points) by a set amount and earning the      |
  |     player some ghost coins                                             |

  |                                                                         |
  |   * If certain conditions are met and the numbers on the lock match     |
